## Testing:
- Verify the fix by completing all challenges in a language (e.g., JavaScript: IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13). The CompletionModal should display “🏆 All Challenges Conquered!” with a “Back to Challenges” button and no “Next Challenge” option.
- Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors by running tsc or your build command.
- Check that getNextChallenge skips completed challenges and returns null when all challenges in the selected language are completed.

- Add console tab in the code tab
- Add Get Started / Continue btn, with the title, "Challenge" (/codearena/challenges)
